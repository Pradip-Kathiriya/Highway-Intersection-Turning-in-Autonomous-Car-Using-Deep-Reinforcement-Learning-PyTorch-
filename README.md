<!---# Highway-Intersection-Turning-in-Autonomous-Car-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-PyTorch-
Developed a reinforcement learning pipeline to teach an agent to take turn at highway intersection without colliding with other vehicle using Deep Q-Learning and Epsilon Greedy strategy.-->

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to train an ego vehicle to cross a highway intersection safely avoiding collisions with other vehicles approaching the intersection. Deep Q-Network (DQN) is used as the policy network with epsilon-greedy algorithm for selecting actions. The ego vehicle is rewarded for reaching the final position after crossing the intersection and penalized for collisions with other vehicles. It is also rewarded for moving at higher speeds.

## Requirement
Python 2.0 or above
